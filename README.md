Breast Cancer Prediction
Problem Statement:
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in several nations, including India. With early detection, 97% of women can live for more than 5 years. Statistically, the mortality toll from this disease has risen dramatically in recent decades. If we recognize it early, we may take the necessary measures, resulting in a lower mortality toll. As a result, in addition to pharmaceutical therapies, certain Data Science solutions must be integrated to address the death-causing issue.

Objective:
To Build a breast cancer classifier on the dataset that can be accurately classify as Benign and Malignant.

Attributes:
Sample code number: id number
Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
Mitoses: 1 - 10
Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)

Here I have built models using 7 different classification algorithms KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, Kernel SVM, Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Among those the Decision Tree Classifier gave the best accuracy of nearly 96%. Here's the confusion matrix visualization of Decision Tree Classifier.
